Blockchain Architect (DHO)
I am extending my DHO role in order to see through the implementation of the ENF grant to deploy Hypha on the EOS blockchain. My main responsibility will be to make sure the team successfully fulfills all the remaining milestones on time and to spec.
This is a new proposal because I am changing deferred from 75% to 70%, as our ENF budget is for this purpose. 
This is an extension of my DHO role with the same parameters (except changing deferred from 75 to 70): https://dao.hypha.earth/hypha/proposals/29167
